<h1>New features in zsh version 3.0.6</h1>
Most of these changes are designed to improve compatibility with zsh
version 3.1.6, the latest development release.  However, this release also
fixes all known Year 2000 (Y2K) bugs in zsh 3.0.
<FONT SIZE="+1">History changes:</FONT><BR>
<ul>
  <li>
      whitespace between words is ignored in history searches
  <li>
      new option <code>HIST_REDUCE_BLANKS</code> removes extra whitespace in
      the stored history
  <li>
      support for reading (but not writing) version 3.1.6 history files
</ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Globbing changes:</FONT><BR>
<ul>
  <li>
      the <code>a, c, and m</code> glob qualifiers can now test time in
      seconds;
  <li>
      globbing of number ranges behaves more like character ranges in that
      it can match a prefix of a number, e.g. <code>`<1-5>*'</code> matches
      <code>1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 17, 23skiddoo, 5986,</code> etc., but not
      <code>6, 7, 8ball, 911,</code> etc.
</ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Parameter and expansion changes:</FONT><BR>
<ul>
  <li>
      expansion of <code>~</code> and other globbing flags via
      <code>${~param}</code> do not depend upon <code>EXTENDED_GLOB</code>
      (bug fix)
  <li>
      nested parameter substitutions require braces (this was always the
      documented behavior, but previous parsers didn't enforce it);
      quote only nested expansion, e.g. <code>${(f)"$(&lt;file)"}</code>
      reads complete `file', then splits lines into array
</ul>
      <FONT SIZE="+1">Builtin and function changes:</FONT><BR>
<ul>
  <li>
      <code>`typeset -U'</code> works on the colon-array version of linked
      parameters
  <li>
      <code>`typeset +f' and `functions +'</code> output the names (only) of
      functions
  <li>
      <code>`emulate -L'</code> has the effect of
      <code>`setopt localoptions'</code>
  <li>
      in <code>fn1() { local foo; unset foo; foo=bar; }</code>,
      <code>foo</code> is restored at local level, whereas if the
      <code>`unset foo'</code> appeared in a nested function it would have
      been restored at global level, which was presumably wrong.
      <code>`foo=bar >&amp;file'</code> is a redirection, not a
      <code>NULLCMD</code>
  <li>
      any single complex command, such as <code>`case ... esac'</code>,
      parses as if semicolon-terminated (bug fix)
  <li>
      the shell function <code>`preexec'</code>, if defined, is run after
      parsing each command line but before executing the command
</ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Other changes:</FONT><BR>
<ul>
   <li>
      the option <code>PRINT_EIGHT_BIT</code> causes zsh to emit raw bytes
      in prompts and completion lists even if the system <code>ctype(3)</code>
      package says that those bytes are not "printable."
</ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Debugging enhancements:</FONT><BR>
<ul>
   <li>
      <code>LINENO</code> is now very much more useful in scripts and
      functions and is reported correctly in most error messages;
      <code>ERREXIT</code> behavior is now consistent with newer
      Bourne-like shells, e.g. with respect to `if' tests that fail
</ul>
<FONT SIZE="+1">Configuration changes:</FONT><BR>
<ul>
   <li>
      Large file and 64-bit integers on 32-bit machines supported where
      provided by OS
   <li>
      a few more system features, such as getpwnam/getpwuid, are tested
      for
</ul>
<h1>New features in zsh version 3.0</h1>
<ul>
  <li>
      Traps defined by the trap builtin are now executed in the current shell
      environment and not as a shell function.  This means that $1 is not set
      to the signal number.  Of course the <code>TRAPxxx</code>
      functions continue working as before.

  <li>
      Traps defined by the trap builtin are reset to their default values in
      subshells.

  <li>
      Option names can be prefixed by `no' to unset an
      option. <code>setopt no_option_name</code> is the same as
      <code>unsetopt option_name</code>. This change affects the
      output of the setopt and unsetopt builtins when these are
      invoked without arguments.  See the zshoptions manual page for
      more explanation.

  <li>
      <code>!, {, } and [[</code> are now reserved words.  Things like
      <code>[[-z $foo]]</code> or <code>{foo}</code> should not be
      used.  <code>{foo}</code> still works if the
      <code>IGNORE_BRACES</code> option is not set but this feature
      may be removed in the future.  <code>[[ -z $foo ]]</code> and
      <code>{ foo }</code> should be used instead.

  <li>
      <code>HOSTTYPE</code> special parameter is removed.  The new
      <code>OSTYPE, MACHTYPE</code> and <code>VENDOR</code> parameters
      should be used instead.

  <li>
      exec now saves the history in interactive shells.  If you do not
      like this behaviour you can alias exec to <code>'unset HISTFILE
      ; exec</code>'.

  <li>
      <code> ${~spec}, ${=spec} and ${^spec}</code> used to toggle the
      effect of <code>globsubst/shwordsplit/rcexpandparam</code>.  Now
      these force the corresponding option on. <code>~, = or ^</code>
      can be doubled to force the relevant option off for the substitution.

  <li>
      Explicitly requested word splitting like <code>${=spec}</code>
      or<code> ${(s:delim:)spec}</code> will be executed even if the
      substitution is double quoted.

  <li>
      The right-hand side of assignments are no longer globbed by
      default hence assignment <code>foo=*</code> will assign
      '<code>*</code>' as a value of foo.  Use the 
      <code>foo=( * )</code> array assignment syntax to get the old
      behaviour.
      Alternatively the <code>GLOB_ASSIGN</code> can be set to emulate
      the old behaviour but the usage of this option is strongly
      discouraged and this option may be completely removed in the
      future.

  <li>
      When foo is an array parameter <code>${#foo}</code> will always
      return the length of the array even if the substitution is
      double quoted.  <code>${(c)#foo}</code> should be used to get
      back the old behaviour.

  <li>

      When the <code>prompt_subst</code> option is set prompts are
      fully expanded using parameter expansion, command substitution
      and arithmetic expansion. In 2.5 backquote substitution
      was not performed in the prompts so this change might cause
      problems in some startup scripts if<code> ` </code>is used
      literally in prompts.

  <li>
      History substitution is now not performed if the history escape
      character appears in a single-quoted string.  This may break
      some interactive shell functions which use <code>\!</code> in
      single-quoted strings.

  <li>
      The <code>UID, EUID, GID, EGID</code> parameters can be assigned
      now. The assignment executes the <i>setuid(), seteuid(),
      setgid(), setegid()</i> respectively.  On systems where
      <i>setuid</i> and <i>seteuid</i> is not supported these
      functions are emulated using <i>setreuid</i> which may result in
      a different behaviour.

  <li>
      Assigning the <code>USERNAME</code> parameter will call
      <i>setuid(uid)</i> where uid is the user id of the specified user.

  <li>
      The privileged (<code>-p</code>) option is automatically set on
      invocation if euid != uid or egid != gid.  If this option is set
      no user startup files are sourced. The shell will drop
      privileges when this option is unset.

  <li>
      The <code>=number</code> substitution for accessing the
      directory stack is changed to <code>~number</code> to allow
      <code>=command</code> substitution when a command name begins
      with a digit.

  <li>
      <code>&lt;&gt;</code> is a redirection operator which opens the
      standard input for both reading and writing.  To match a number
      use <code>&lt;-&gt;</code>.

  <li>
      Option letters <code>-1</code> and <code>-C</code> for
      <code>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</code>and <code>NO_CLOBBER</code> are
      swapped: `<code>set -C</code>' sets <code>NO_CLOBBER</code> and
      `<code>set -1</code>' sets <code>PRINT_EXIT_VALUE</code>.

  <li>
      <code>AUTO_PUSHD</code> behaviour is changed.  Now cd without
      arguments will always go to the <code>$HOME</code> directory
      even if <code>AUTO_PUSHD</code> is set and
      <code>PUSHD_TO_HOME</code> is not set.  If you preferred the old
      behaviour you can alias <code>cd</code> to <code>pushd</code>.

  <li>
      <code>IFS</code> word splitting with <code>SH_WORD_SPLIT</code>
      and the splitting of the input in the read builtin has changed
      in cases when <code>IFS</code> contains characters other than
      <code>&lt;space&gt;, &lt;tab&gt;, &lt;newline&gt;</code>.  See
      the description of <code>IFS</code> in the zshparam manual page
      for more details.
