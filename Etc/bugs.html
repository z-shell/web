<title>ZSH 3.0.0 Bug List</title>

<h1><img src="../Images/smallbug.gif">Some bugs</h1>
This is the latest bug list for zsh version 3.0 (3.0.0).

<hr>
Completion has a habit of doing the wrong thing after a
backslash/newline.

<hr>
If you suspend <code>man</code>, zle seems to get into cooked mode.
It works ok for plain <code>less</code>.
It is not specific neither to man nor to zsh.
E.g. call the following program foo:
<blockquote>
<code>
#include <sys/wait.h>
#include <unistd.h>

int main(int argc, char *argv[])
{
    int status;

    if (!fork())	/* child */
	execvp(argv[1], argv + 1);
    else		/* parent */
	wait(&status);
}
</code>
</blockquote>
Then if you suspend
<code>% foo less something</code>
from zsh/bash, zle/readline gets into cooked mode.

<hr>
<code>% zsh -c 'cat a_long_file | less ; :'</code>
can be interrupted with <code>^C</code>. The prompt comes back and
less is orphaed. If you go to the end of the file with less and cat
terminates, <code>^C</code> will not terminate less. The `; :' after
less forces zsh to fork before executing less.

<hr>
The pattern <code>%?*</code> maches names beginning with
<code>%?</code> instead of names with at least two characters
beginning with <code>%</code>. This is a hack to allow
<code>%?foo</code> job substitution without quoting. This behaviour is
incompatible with sh and ksh and may be removed in the future. A good
fix would be to keep such patterns unchanged if they do not match
regardless of the state of the nonomatch and nullglob options.

<hr>
Username completion may cause SEGV on SunOS 4.1.3 and NIS.
This is not a zsh bug.  See Etc/MACHINES for details.
