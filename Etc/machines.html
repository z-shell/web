<h1>ZSH on specific architectures</h1>
<p>These are the OSes that zsh has been tried on.  If you succeed in getting
zsh to work on an OS not listed, let us know.</p>

<p>On all machines if you use gcc and upgrade your OS you must rebuild gcc
after the OS upgrade.  A gcc left from a previous OS may seem to work
but compiling more complex programs may fail mysteriously.</p>

<dt><b>Apple: MacOS X/Darwin 1.4</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should build `out-of-the-box'.</p>

  <p>For dynamic loading to work, you need to use the dlcompat library.
  It can be downloaded from:
  <a href="http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203">http://sourceforge.net/project/showfiles.php?group_id=17203</a>.</p>

<dt><b>Red Hat Inc.: Cygwin</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should build `out-of-the-box'.  The compilation directory should be on a
  file system mounted as binary (the mount command shows `binmode'). There are
  various issues with Cygwin versions before 1.3.2 - you are adviced to update
  to the latest release.</p>

  <p>Dynamic loading works as of cygwin-1.1.3 and binutils-20000722-1. It was
  not tested for earlier versions. This does not imply that every module will
  work. New completion and in particular zsh/zftp and zsh/mathfunc are known to
  work.

  <p>Some of the tests in the Test subdirectory are known to fail: this is
  because the UNIX environment is not completely implemented.

  <p>Cygwin allows mount without existing mount point (e.g. "<tt>mount
  //server/path /usr/src</tt>" where /usr/src does not exist). Path completion
  will fail inside these mounts; make sure that every mount point really
  exists.
</dd>

<dt><b>DEC: Ultrix (Alpha or DECstation)<br>
DEC: Mach 3.0 (DECstation 5000/25)<br>
DEC: OSF/1 1.2, 1.3, 2.0, 3.*, DEC Unix 4.* (Alpha)<br>
Compaq: Tru64</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>In OSF/1 3.x, there is apparently a bug in the header file
  /usr/include/rpcsvc/ypclnt.h; the prototype for yp_all() has a struct
  ypall_callback as its final argument, which should be a pointer (struct
  ypall_callback *).  This prevents compilation of one of zsh' files
  (zle_tricky.c).  If you can't modify the header file, create a directory
  called `rpcsvc' in zsh's Src subdirectory and put a fixed version of the
  header file to it before compiling.

  <p>The strip coming with gcc-2.7.2 seems to create unusable binaries. This
  problem is not related to zsh.  If you have such problems, remove the bogus
  strip and use /bin/strip instead.

  <p>On Digital UNIX 4.0, compilation with gcc and with --enable-dynamic
  apparently needs configuring with explicit flags when compiling
  with debugging enabled:<br>
   <tt>DLLD=gcc LDFLAGS='-g -rpath <path-to-.so-files>' ./configure ...</tt>
</dd>

<dt><b>FreeBSD: FreeBSD 2.2.7, 3.x, 4.x</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should build `out-of-the-box'.  On FreeBSD 2.2, dynamic loading does not
  work, but it does with 3.x and 4.x.
</dd>

<dt><b>HP: HP-UX 9, 10.20, 11.0</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should build `out-of-the-box'.

  <p>Problems with dynamic loading have been reported under 11, but
  this should compile using the standard dlopen() function set
  (rather than the 10.20 shl_load() function set).  More details of
  any difficulties would be appreciated.

  <p>Compiling with gcc 2.7.1 is known to fail with header file
  conflicts on HP-UX 11. Use the HP ANSI C compiler.
</dd>

<dt><b>IBM: AIX 3.2, 4.1</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should build `out-of-the-box', but --enable-zsh-mem will not work.

  <p>On 3.2, for 64-bit integer support you need to compile with gcc, as
  the native compiler does not support ANSI simultaneously with
  `long long'.  On 4.1, there appear to be problems using
  --enable-dynamic (the default) with gcc (version was 2.7.2.3) in
  4.1, though native cc works. More information about this problem
  would be appreciated.

  <p>It was reported, that at least some 4.x versions have problem
  with curses - variables boolcodes and some other are declared
  in term.h but missing is libcurses.a. That makes native compiler
  very unhappy (GCC 3.0 apparently does not mind). Zsh now defaults
  to termcap on AIX; any info about this problem is appreciated.

</dd>

<dt><b>Linux: Linux 2.* (various 32-bit and 64-bit processors)</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should build `out-of-the-box'.

  <p>If you are using an early minor version of libc 5, then a bug
  in the auto-configuration process may cause zsh to think that
  your system doesn't support the lstat function.  If the configure
  process reports that there is no lstat, edit config.h and change
  HAVE_LSTAT to 1.  libc-5.2.18 or later does not have this problem.

  <p>Various problems have been reported when using optimisation
  with the experimental GNU compiler, egcs.  In particular,
  on Linux Alpha with egcs 1.0.3a and 1.1.1 using -O1 or greater,
  the completion code is not correctly compiled.

  <p>Some versions of glibc2 have a conflict with <asm/resource.h>
  which causes a redefinition warning on RLIM_INFINITY.  This
  causes configure to decide that <sys/resource.h> is not present,
  which can cause compilation errors in zsh's rlimit code.  The
  best solution is to edit config.h after running configure and
  #define HAS_SYS_RESOURCE_H.
</dd>

<dt><b>NetBSD: NetBSD 1.*</b></dt>
<dd>Should build `out-of-the-box'.</dd>

<dt><b>OpenBSD: OpenBSD 2.6</b></dt>
<dd>Should build `out-of-the-box'.</dd>

<dt><b>SIEMENS: Reliant UNIX</b></dt>
<dd>Builds `out-of-the-box'. Dynamic loading is supported. 
Large Files and 64-bit integers are supported as of version 5.44
and CDS/CDS++ compiler.</dd>

<dt><b>SIEMENS: SINIX</b></dt>
<dd>
<p>MX (Intel) platform: SINIX-L/M 5.41<br>
Builds out-of-the-box with EGCS. Neither dynamic loading nor
64-bit integers are supported. Native compiler was not tried
mostly because GCC/EGCS builds out-of-the-box as well. If you 
succeed with native compiler, send a patch for this file
to zsh-workers.

<p>RM (MIPS) platform: SINIX-N/Y 5.42<br>
Should build out-of-the-box but it was not tested. Neither
dynamic loading nor 64-bit integers are supported.
Note, that this version is obsolete and users are expected to 
update to Reliant UNIX.</dd>
</dd>

<dt><b>SGI: IRIX 6.2, 6.3, 6.5</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>Should build `out-of-the-box'.

  <p>On 6.5.2, zsh malloc routines are reported not to work; also
  full optimization (cc -O3 -OPT:Olimit=0) causes problems.

  <p>The zpty module is not currently supported.
</dd>

<dt><b>Sun: SunOS 4.1.*</b></dt>
  <dd>Under 4.1.3 if yellow pages is used, username completion may cause
  segmentation violation.  This is a bug in the shared library not in zsh. 
  Some libc.so.1.9.* has this bug (it fails in yp_all). Statically linked
  binaries will work if linked with libc.so.1.8.1 (which means that if you can
  get a statically linked binary compiled under 4.1.2 that it will probably
  work).  An alternative but untested solution may be to undefine HAVE_NIS in
  config.h. This may work, but the first username completion will be _very_
  slow (as slow as in tcsh).</dd>

<dt><b>Sun: Solaris 2.*</b></dt>
<dd>
  <p>The UCB versions of the routines for reading directories are not
  usable (the struct definitions are incompatible with the ones
  assumed by zsh).  The symptom of this is that globbed filenames in
  the compiled version of zsh will be missing the first two letters.
  To avoid this, make sure you compile zsh without any reference
  to /usr/ucblib in your LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  You can easily do this
  by just unsetting LD_LIBRARY_PATH before building zsh.

  <p>Problems have been reported using --enable-lfs (the default) to
  enable large file system and integer support on Solaris 2 with gcc.
  Apparently upgrading to gcc version 2.95.2 fixes this.  If this
  is not feasible, configure with --disable-lfs.  We would be
  grateful for more detailed information.  The most problems seem
  to occur on Solaris 2.6, where --disable-lfs is recommended.
</dd>

<h2>Other machines</h2>

<p>Zsh has previously been compiled on the following machines, but the
developers do not have direct access to them and the reports may be out of
date.  We would be glad to receive any reports of success or failure on
these OS's &mdash; and, of course, any others not mentioned in this file.</p>

<dt><b>Apple/NeXT OpenStep 4.2 for i386.</b></dt>
  <dd>Reported to work at least with gcc 2.8.1 and gawk 2.15 patchlevel
  6, but not with the bundled cc 2.7.2.1 and awk.</dd>

<dt><b>Cray: Unicos (C90 and T90)</b></dt>
  <dd>Should build `out-of-the-box'.</dd>

<dt><b>Data General: DG/UX 5.4R3.10 MU01 (various AViiONs)</b></dt>
  <dd>Should build `out-of-the-box'.</dd>

<dt><b>Next: NextStep 3.*</b></dt>
  <dd>Should build `out-of-the-box', but the zsh malloc routines are not
  recommended.</dd>

<dt><b>SCO: UnixWare 2.1.3</b></dt>
