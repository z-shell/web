<h1>Zsh version 3.0 has now been released!</h1>
<hr>
More than two years passed since the previous production release,
zsh-2.5.0.  The new release is much more stable than zsh-2.5.0.  Several
hundred bugs have been fixed (although no one counted) and several new
features were added.  Everyone using zsh-2.5.0 or earlier is encouraged to
upgrade.

<p>
Note that some incompatible changes have been made to zsh so old
scripts may have to be modified to run with zsh-3.0.  Before sending a
bug-report check the manual pages and the NEWS file.  If you find a
bug, report it to <a href="mailto:zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu">
<i>zsh-workers@math.gatech.edu</i></a>.  If you would like to receive
announcements about new releases and monthly FAQ updates, send mail to
<a href="mailto:zsh-announce-request@math.gatech.edu">

For those who do not know what zsh is:
<p>
The Z-shell, zsh is the most powerful freely available Unix command
interpreter.  It most resembles the Korn shell (ksh).  It includes
<ul>
  <li>a very powerful command-line editor with 162 key-bindings which can
   even be used to edit files

  <li>a very powerful command-line editor with 162 key-bindings which can
   even be used to edit files

  <li>102 options for customizing its behavior

  <li>81 built-ins

  <li>very powerful filename globing which can do almost everything that
   find can do

  <li>fully programmable completion

  <li>spelling correction

  <li>powerful substitution features which can often be used instead of cut
   or sed

  <li>features to make C-shell (csh) users feel more at home and extra
   features drawn from tcsh (another `custom' shell).
</ul>

Zsh is one of the most portable program available for Unix.  It uses GNU
autoconf and it builds out of the box on most systems.
<p>

Zsh can emulate the POSIX shell and the Korn shell quite well when it is
invoked as sh or ksh respectively.  On Linux and probably on other systems
too /bin/sh can be linked to zsh.
<p>

The latest release, the zsh FAQ and documentation is available from the
following anonymous ftp sites.  The first is the official archive site.
The rest are mirror sites which are kept frequently up to date.  The sites
marked with a star may mirror ftp.math.gatech.edu instead of the primary
site.
