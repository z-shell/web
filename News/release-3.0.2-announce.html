      <h1>Zsh version 3.0.2 has now been released!</h1>
      <hr>
      This is a bugfix only version.  Everybody using zsh-3.0.1 or
      older should consider upgrading to zsh-3.0.2.
      <p>

	This is intended to be the last 3.0 release.  If there is no
	new serious bug report, the next production release will be
	zsh-3.2.  The next development release, zsh-3.1.0 will soon be
	available from the arcive sites.  It will support dynamically
	loadable binary modules on systems which support dynamic
	loading.  This feature will make the shell easily extensible
	with new builtins and editor functions. Existing parts of zsh
	including the line editor and some builtins will be moved to
	separate modules which are only loaded when they are needed.
	This can improve the startup time of zsh when it is executing
	shell scripts.
