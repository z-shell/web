<dd>Add support for genuine assignment syntax after keywords such as "local"
and "typeset". Text pasted within X terminals is safer as it appears as

<dd>Bug fixes and some minor improvements.</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2008-11-03</font> : <b>Release 4.3.9</b></font></dt>
<dd>Improved multibyte support on MacOS, updated prompt system and better
debug support.</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2008-08-29</font> : <b>Zsh for Symbian OS.</b></font></dt>
<dd><a href="http://www.symbian.com/">Symbian</a> has released a port of
Zsh, together with telnetd, onto Symbian OS using its P.I.P.S. layer.
The combination of Zsh and a telnet daemon running on a real phone or
emulator allows users to launch a Unix-like shell from a PC running a
generic telnet client, over a pre-established TCP/IP connection. More information at
<a href="http://developer.symbian.com/wiki/display/pub/P.I.P.S.">http://developer.symbian.com/wiki/display/pub/P.I.P.S.</a>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2008-04-02</font> : <b>Release 4.3.6</b></font></dt>
<dd>Contains mostly bug fixes, but there are some small
improvements. No incompatibilities with previous versions are known.

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2008-02-04</font> : <b>Releases 4.2.7 and 4.3.5</b></font></dt>
<dd>The stable (4.2.7) release was actually out in December containing various
bug fixes and completion improvements backported from the development branch. 4.3.5 contains both bugfixes and improvements. Further progress
has been made in support for multibyte character sets. In most cases,
this is thought to be stable, although a few glitches remain.
Combining characters are still not supported. There have been
enhancements to the module system to allow selective loading. There
is a new module for access to the curses screen manipulation package.

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2007-04-19</font> : <b>Release 4.3.4</b></font></dt>
<dd>This now contains most of the planned support for multibyte
characters. There are still some problems notably with Unicode combining
characters and composition of characters (notably on MacOS). 

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2006-03-02</font> : <b>Release 4.3.2</b></font></dt>
<dd>This is a bug-fix release for two minor build problems that some users experienced.

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2006-02-28</font> : <b>Release 4.3.1</b></font></dt>
<dd>This is the first release of the 4.3 series, which
contains initial support for multibyte characters in the
shell's line editor (in particular UTF-8, although any character set
supported by the system library is usable). Please read the appropriate
sections of the file INSTALL as this support might not be turned on by default
on some systems where it can be used. The release also contains a few
enhancements to shell syntax and supplied functions, as well as numerous
bug fixes. See the file NEWS for more detail. There are only a few
unavoidable incompatibilities with previous versions, mostly to enhance
compatibility with other shells and standards; see the README file.

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2005-12-05</font> : <b>Release 4.2.6</b></font></dt>
<dd>This is a bug fix release for the stable 4.2 series. A new development version 4.3.1 will be released soon, containing support in the line editor for multibyte character sets such as UTF-8.</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2005-04-06</font> : <b>Release 4.2.5</b></font></dt>
<dd>This is a bug fix release for the stable 4.2 series. It fixes a few configuration problems, notably on Mac OS X, as well as a number of other minor issues. There are also some upgrades to completion functions. Upgrading from 4.2.4 should not cause any incompatibilities.</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2005-02-08</font> : <b>Work starts on Unicode support</b></font></dt>
<dd>Work has now begun on what has recently become the most requested
feature: support for multibyte character sets. Initial changes are
focussing on the line editor (ZLE). In advance of this commencing, 4.2.2
was released. Further bug fixes to the 4.2 series are taking place on
a branch and once there is something useful to test, a 4.3 series will
begin. The latest stable release is now actually <b>4.2.4</b>: there
were a few bugs and compilation issues which needed fixing.</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2004-12-16</font> : <b>Zsh book published</b></font></dt>
<dd>
Last month, a book titled <i>From Bash to Z Shell: Conquering the
Command Line</i> was published and it is now available. It covers zsh
in detail. More information and a sample chapter is available on the <a
href="http://www.apress.com/book/bookDisplay.html?bID=361">publisher's
web page</a>. You can also read <a

on Amazon</a>.
</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2004-08-13</font> : <b>Release 4.2.1</b></font>
<dd>
This adds a number of minor new features along with bug fixes. For more
information, see the <a href="../Etc/changelog-4.2.html">detailed changelog</a>.
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2004-03-19</font> : <b>Release 4.2.0</b></font>
<dd>
This is a stable release containing a number of improvements over the
4.0 series. For details of the changes, see the
<a href="../releases.html">release notes</a> or
<a href="../Etc/changelog-4.1.html">detailed changelog</a>.
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2003-12-18</font> : <b>Release 4.0.8</b></font>
<dd>
This is a maintenance release of the stable 4.0 series. Most of the
changes are bug fixes. There are some local improvements to various
completion functions too. The 4.0.9 release which followed shortly after
fixed a compile problem so if you have 4.0.8, there is not need to upgrade.
<p>
This is likely to be the last 4.0 release. After 4.1.2, there will be
a 4.2.0 as the 4.1 line looks stable. The
<a href="../Etc/changelog-4.0.html">detailed changelog</a> for the 4.0 series
is available.
</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2003-07-04</font> : <b>qconfirm enabled on mailing lists</b></font>
<dd>
Due to the excessive amount on Viruses getting through on the mailing
lists, qconfirm has now been enabled for them. This means that if you
don't subscribe, you will have to confirm any messages you send. Apologies
for this inconvenience.
</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2003-06-19</font> : <b>Releases 4.1.1 &amp; 4.0.7</b></font>
<dd>
Not one but two new releases. Changes in 4.0.7 are mostly bug fixes
with some enhancements to completion functions. 4.1.1 is the first
full release of the 4.1 branch. For those who haven't been following
development all that closely, 4.1.1 has been a long while in gestation
and should be relatively stable. Unless you are particularly paranoid,
it is probably reasonable to upgrade from 4.0.
</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2002-08-14</font> : <b>Release 4.0.6</b></font>
<dd>
This is a maintenance release of the stable 4.0 series. The majority of changes
are bug fixes or minor enhancements to the function based completion system.
</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2002-08-08</font> : <b>New zsh wiki</b></font>
<dd>
Thanks to Bruno Bonfils, there is now a <a href="http://www.zshwiki.org/">wiki about zsh</a>. 
Anyone can add information (that being the purpose of a wiki) into the website.
</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2001-10-26</font> : <b>Release 4.0.4</b></font>
<dd>
This is a maintenance release of the stable 4.0 series. A large number
of small bugfixes have been made covering the whole shell. There are
very few user-visible changes, mostly minor enhancements to the
completion function system. Some configuration and compilation issues
have been addressed to improve compatibility with AIX, MacOS X/Darwin,
and QNX Neutrino.
</dd>
<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2001-10-15</font> : <b>Daily CVS snapshots now available</b></font>
<dd>
It is now possible to download daily snapshots of the zsh source which are
taken from the CVS respository. Details on where to get them are on the
<strike>page for cvs related stuff</strike> (switched to Git).
</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2001-06-27</font> : <b>Release 4.0.2</b></font>
<dd>This is a maintenance release for the (stable) 4.0 branch. Most of the
changes are bug fixes, including a fix for a bug which caused the test
suite to fail. On fully supported systems, all tests should now pass.
<p>
There is one new feature: the option KSH_TYPESET provides compatibility
with other shells for assignment arguments of `typeset', `export' and
related builtins.
<p>
Work has also started on the 4.1 branch. New features include `for' loops
taking multiple parameter names before the `in' or left parenthesis, each of
which takes one word from the list on each iteration.
</dd>

<dt><font size="+1"><font color="red">2001-06-01</font> : <b>Release 4.0.1</b></font>
<dd>Version 4.0.1 of zsh, has been released. This is a stable release with many
enhancements over the previous stable release, particulary in the areas of
completion, line editing, modularity and parameter substitution.

<dt> <font size="+1"><font color=red>2000-06-05</font> : <b>Release 3.1.9</b></font>
 <dd>
     Version 3.1.8 and 3.1.9 are primarily bug fix releases.
<p>

<dt> <font size="+1"><font color=red>2000-05-31</font> : <b>Release 3.1.7</b></font>
 <dd>
     The new improved Zsh, now with more features than ever before is available
     from Zsh distributions sites. The beta branch is recommended for anyone
     wanting all these extra features at the expense of having to cope with a
     few obscure bugs. This is intended to be the last 3.1 release before 4.0.
     See the <a href="../Etc/changelog-3.1.html">detailed changelog</a>.
<p>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>2000-05-16</FONT> : <B>Release 3.0.8</B></FONT>
 <DD>
     Maintenance release 3.0.8 is available from Zsh distributions sites. See
     the <A HREF="../Etc/changelog-3.0.html">detailed changelog</A>.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>2000-04-03</FONT> : <B>Use of SourceForge</B></FONT>
 <DD>
     We are now making use of <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</A>.
     This means that we now have an official CVS repository. See our
     <A HREF="http://sourceforge.net/project/?group_id=4068">summary page there</A>.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>1999-10-19</FONT> : <B>Release 3.0.7</B></FONT>

     Maintenance release 3.0.7 is available from Zsh distribution sites.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>1999-08-01</FONT> : <B>Releases 3.0.6 &amp; 3.1.6</B></FONT>
  <DD>
     Yes, not one but two releases.<BR>
     &gt; Version <B>3.0.6</B> is out. After just
     under two years since the last release, a major effort by Bart Schaefer
     brings this well loved and bugfixed version to the public. This stable
     version is recommended for the hardy production sites that need the
     proven stability of the 3.0 series.
     <BR>
     &gt; Version <B>3.1.6</B> is also available. Peter Stephenson has brought
     you the latest development version of Zsh. Now with more features than
     ever, 3.1.6 does it all...<CITE>well, nearly</CITE>... This beta version is
     recommended for everyone who is wanting the shell with the most...
     <CITE>something</CITE>.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>1999-06-29</FONT> : <B>The New Maintainers</B></FONT>
  <DD>
     Head's up!  There is not one new Zsh co-ordinator - there are <U>two</U>!<BR>
     &gt; Bart Schaefer has rolled up his sleaves and is taking on the nitty
     gritty of the next (and maybe final) maintenance release for the 3.0
     series, to provide you with a more stable, less bug-prone shell. 
     (<CITE>They're not bugs, they're just undocumented features</CITE>)<BR>
     &gt; Peter Stephenson is down in the dirt, cleaning off the mud from
     the next series of the shell you love. With binary modules, it can be
     everything you could want it to be, even your new FTP client!
     (<CITE>Put it up to your ear and you can hear the sea</CITE>)
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>1999-02-26</FONT> : <B>Zefram (Andrew Main) Lives</B></FONT>
  <DD>
     After a period of walkabout, Zefram - the Zsh co-ordinator -
     reemerges from the desert and proclaims life for Zsh.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>1999-02-22</FONT> : <B>3.1 development branch is firing</B></FONT>
  <DD>
     Peter Stephenson (pro tem. co-ordinator) and Sven Wischnowsky are way
     out in front with new ideas and masses of new contributions. The rest
     of the Zsh workers crew aren't disgracing themselves either. Peter
     is making releases available from his own pages. Joining the zsh-workers
     <A HREF="../Arc/mlist.html">mailing list</A> is a must to follow all
     this development so there won't be links to them here - get the
     announcements on zsh-workers.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>1999-02-11</FONT> : <B>www.zsh.org mailing list archive up</B></FONT>
  <DD>
     The mailing list archive at www.zsh.org is resynchronised with the
     lists and actively tracking.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><FONT COLOR=RED>1999-01-27</FONT> : <B>Mailing List location changes</B></FONT>
  <DD>
      The mailing list has changed its address. See the
      <A HREF="../Arc/mlist.html">Mailing List</A> page for new
      information. The archive on www.zsh.org will be down until
      teething problems are sorted out.
<P>
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Version 3.1 in beta test release.</B></FONT>
  <DD>
      Work on version 3.1 of zsh is well underway, with the major new
      feature being support for binary modules. There is a preliminary
      version, but you should join the zsh-worker mailing list before
      you consider downloading it. Preliminary tests using ELF on
      Linux, SunOS, and Solaris have been encouraging; the hardest part
      will be to make it portable. Some ideas on portability issues
      are being borrowed from version 5 of perl.
      Version 3.1.5 of zsh was <a href="release-3.1.5-announce.html">
      released October 30 1998</a>.
<P>      
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Version 3.0.5 released!</B></FONT>
  <DD>
      Version 3.0.5 of zsh was released September 26 1997.
<P>      
<DT> <FONT SIZE="+1"><B>Version 2.5</B></FONT>
  <DD>
      This version is still available, but it is deprecated and its
      continued use is <STRONG>strongly</STRONG> discouraged.
