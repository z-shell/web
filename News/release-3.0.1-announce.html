      <h1>Zsh version 3.0.1 has now been released!</h1>
      <hr>
      This is mainly a bugfix version.  It contains exactly one new feature: a
      new -N conditional test is added which basically tells you if there is a
      new mail in a given mail folder.  See Functions/checkmail and the manual
      for details.
      <p>

	Everybody using zsh-3.0.0 should consider upgrading to zsh-3.0.1.  This
	version hopfully compiles without modifications on Cray, OSF and HP-UX
	systems with both cc and gcc.
