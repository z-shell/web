<h1>Zsh version 3.1.5 has now been released!</h1>
<hr>
<ul>
  <li> Globbing now supports the POSIX character classes, so that, for example,
       [[:upper:]_] now does what was traditionally expressed as [A-Z_].
  <li> The universal-argument ZLE function now behaves like the EMACS one,
       accepting an arbitrary numeric argument.
  <li> A bug in utmp handling that prevented compilation on HP-UX is fixed.
  <li> There are many bugfixes and other changes.  For a more detailed list,
       see the <A HREF="../Etc/changelog-3.1.html">ChangeLog</A> file.
