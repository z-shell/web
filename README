Website
-------

The website is _not_ automatically synchronized with the Git repository.


You can fetch the current version of the published website with:

    rsync -avi $SF_USER,zsh@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/ .

$SF_USER is your Sourceforge user name, you need SSH access for this to work.

To upload the committed changes use:

    git status -uall --ignored
    rsync -avi --no-perms --delete --exclude .git . $SF_USER,zsh@web.sourceforge.net:htdocs/

`--no-perms` is important if you have a strict umask or the pages are not
accessible.

The Git repository for the website can be cloned with

    git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/zsh/web zsh

*Don't upload any uncommitted changes!*


Release
-------

To prepare a new release use the `release.zsh` script. $ZSHPATH must point to
a current checkout of the Zsh source repository.

    ZSHPATH=/path/to/zsh/ ./release.zsh

Follow the instructions and check the results. Then commit the changes and tag
the commit with:

    git tag -s -m "Release of zsh $ZSH_VERSION" zsh-$ZSH_VERSION
