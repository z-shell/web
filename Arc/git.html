<h3>Source Code</h3>

<p>
The source code is managed in a Git repository
hosted by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. To clone
the repository use the following command.

<pre>git clone git://git.code.sf.net/p/zsh/code zsh</pre>

You can also browse the repository online through SourceForge's Git
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/p/zsh/code/">viewer</a>.
<p>
To build it, you will need to run <tt>Util/preconfig</tt> to build the
configure script. This requires that you have a copy of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
installed. Documentation is pre-built for the releases so unless you have
<a href="http://yodl.sourceforge.net/">Yodl</a> installed builds
from Git sources will fail when they come to build documentation. This is
after zsh itself has been built so don't let that error worry you.

<p>
The master branch contains the current development.
<p>
Be aware that if you obtain your copy of Zsh in any of the ways described on
this page, it is likely to contain many more bugs than the official releases. If
you're not interested in having the very latest features and just want to get on
with some real work get the latest stable release.

<h3>Contributing</h3>

<p>Contributions should be sent to the <tt>zsh-workers@zsh.org</tt>
<a href="mlist.html">mailing list</a> in the form of patch files. To
generate a patch, you can use <code>git diff</code>. We prefer patches to be
included inline in the body of the message because it makes it easier to
comment on particular lines. However, if you can't do that without your
e-mail program wrapping long lines, then attachments are also fine.
<p>
Note that you don't as such need to be subscribed to post to the
mailing list. It does have a spam filter that is sometimes over zealous
so please keep an eye on the <a href="http://www.zsh.org/mla/">list
archives</a> to ensure that your message arrives.

<p>There are mirrors of the git repository at <a href="https://github.com/zsh-users/zsh/">github</a>
and <a href="https://gitlab.com/zsh-org/zsh/">gitlab</a>. In the case of
contributions to completion functions, you are welcome to submit pull/merge
requests via either of these.</p>
