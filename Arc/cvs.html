<p>
The very latest and greatest version of Zsh is held in a CVS repository
hosted by <a href="http://sourceforge.net/">SourceForge</a>. Instructions
on how to access this is on the
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/cvs/?group_id=4068">Zsh CVS Repository web page</a>.
To build it, you will need to run <tt>Util/preconfig</tt> to build the
configure script. This requires that you have a copy of
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/autoconf.html">autoconf</a>
installed. Documentation is pre-built for the releases so unless you have
Yodl installed builds
from cvs sources will fail when they come to build documentation. This is
after zsh itself has been built so don't let that error worry you.
Zsh is usually built with version 1 of Yodl, which is hard to find
these days (packages may be available if you search Google), however
<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/yodl/">version 2</a> is
also available from Sourceforge.

<p>
Currently we have two active branches in the CVS repository. The cvs
<i>HEAD</i> branch contains the latest 4.3.x changes while the 4.2.x
branch is tagged <i>zsh-4_2-patches</i>. You can check out the latter
with the <tt>-r</tt> option to <tt>cvs checkout</tt>.

<!-- (Currently not available.)
<p>
If you don't have a CVS client, you can download a snapshot of the cvs
repository. The following snapshots are available:
<ul>
<li><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/zsh-4.3-daily-snapshot.tar.bz2">4.3 branch, bzip2 compressed</a>
<li><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/zsh-4.3-daily-snapshot.tar.gz">4.3 branch, gzip compressed</a>
<li><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/zsh-4.2-daily-snapshot.tar.bz2">4.2 branch, bzip2 compressed</a>
<li><a href="http://zsh.sourceforge.net/zsh-4.2-daily-snapshot.tar.gz">4.2 branch, gzip compressed</a>
</ul>
These are updated periodically. It used to be daily but sourceforge have disabled cron.
-->

<p>
Be aware that if you obtain your copy of Zsh in any of the ways described on
this page, it is likely to contain many more bugs than the official releases. If
you're not interested in having the very latest features and just want to get on
with some real work get the latest stable release.
