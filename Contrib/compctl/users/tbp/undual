# undual - remove a name from the dual list
# 
# Usage:
#   undual [name] . . .
#
# where
#   name   is the name of a shell variable to remove from the
#          dual list.  See dual for more.  You can't remove
#          dual itself from the dual list, which is kind of
#          good.
#
# assumes unsetopt shwordsplit
# Might require a POSIX sed, on account of the
# \(:\|$\) (colon or end of line) construct.  In awk it becomes
# (:|$) which is much easier to read.  I use sed because it's a little
# less memory-hungry.

  # remove the item from the dual list - with dual!
  dual DUAL=$(echo $DUAL | sed "s/:$upper\(:\|$\)/\1/")
  # and remap the dual array to lower case.
