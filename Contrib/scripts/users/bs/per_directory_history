# Relatively easily, yes.  The main issues are security (avoid loading a
# history left for you by someone malicious (though this isn't too bad as
# the commands aren't actually executed)), collision-avoidance in shared
# directories, and handling of non-writable directories.
# 
# The solution looks something like

chpwd() {
    local ohistsize=$HISTSIZE
    fc -W ~-/.history.$UID
    HISTSIZE=0		# Discard previous dir's history
    HISTSIZE=$ohistsize	# Prepare for new dir's history
    fc -R ./.history.$UID
}
