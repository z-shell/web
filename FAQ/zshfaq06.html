<h1>Chapter 6: The future of zsh</h1>
<p>
<a name="l61"></a>
<h2>6.1: What bugs are currently known and unfixed? (Plus recent important changes)</h2>
<a name="51"></a>
<p>
Bugs tend to be tracked on the zsh-workers mailing list; see the
  next section.  Check the mailing list to see if a bug has been
  reported.  (There is a bug tracker at the zsh development site
  at Sourceforge, but it's not in active use.)
<p>
To see how recent versions of the shell have changed, look at
  the README file in the source distribution.  This indicates the
  most important changes, and in particular draws attention to
  incompatibilities you might notice.
<p>

<h2>6.2: Where do I report bugs, get more info / who's working on zsh?</h2>
<a name="52"></a>
<p>
The shell is being maintained by various (entirely self-appointed)
  subscribers to the mailing list,
  <pre>

    zsh-workers@zsh.org
  
</pre>

  so mail on any issues (bug reports, suggestions, complaints...)
  related to the development of the shell should be sent there.  If
  you want someone to mail you directly, say so.  Most patches to zsh
  appear there first.
<p>
Note that this location has just changed (January 1999), and the
  instructions to go with it are slightly different --- in particular,
  if you are already subscribed, the instructions about how to
  unsubscribe are different.
<p>
Please note when reporting bugs that many exist only on certain
  architectures, which the developers may not have access to.  In
  this case debugging information, as detailed as possible, is
  particularly welcome.
<p>
Two progressively lower volume lists exist, one with messages
  concerning the use of zsh,
  <pre>

    zsh-users@zsh.org
  
</pre>

  and one just containing announcements:  about releases, about major
  changes in the shell, or this FAQ, for example,
  <pre>

    zsh-announce@zsh.org
  
</pre>

  (posting to the last one is currently restricted).
<p>
Note that you should only join one of these lists:  people on
  zsh-workers receive all the lists, and people on zsh-users will
  also receive the announcements list.
<p>
The lists are handled by an automated server.  The instructions for
  zsh-announce and zsh-users are the same as for zsh-workers: just
  change zsh-workers to whatever in the following.
<p>
To join zsh-workers, send email to
  <pre>

    zsh-workers-subscribe@zsh.org
  
</pre>

  (the actual content is unimportant).  Replace <code>subscribe</code> with
  <code>unsubscribe</code> to unsubscribe.  The mailing software (<code>ezlm</code>) has
  various bells and whistles: you can retrieve archived messages.
  Mail <a href="mailto:zsh-workers-help@zsh.org"><em>zsh-workers-help@zsh.org</em></a> for detailed information.
  Administrative matters are best sent to
  <a href="mailto:zsh-workers-owner@zsh.org"><em>zsh-workers-owner@zsh.org</em></a>.
  real name is <a href="mailto:Geoff Wing &lt;gcw@zsh.org&gt;"><em>Geoff Wing &lt;gcw@zsh.org&gt;</em></a>.
<p>
An archive of mailings for the last few years can be found at
    <a href="http://www.zsh.org/mla/">http://www.zsh.org/mla/</a>
  at the main zsh archive in Australia.
<p>
Of course, you can also post zsh queries to the Usenet group
  comp.unix.shell; if all else fails, you could even e-mail me.

<h2>6.3: What's on the wish-list?</h2>
<p>
The code bears the marks of the ages and many things could be done much
  better with a rewrite.  A more efficient set of code for
  lexing/parsing/execution might also be an advantage.  Volunteers are
  particularly welcome for these tasks.
<p>
Some future possibilities which have been suggested:
  <ul>
  <li> The shell, in particular the line editor, should support Unicode
     characters.  Initial support for this appeared in version 4.3;
     it is reasonably complete in the line editor but patchy elsewhere
     (note this may require the configuration option --enable-multibyte).
  <li> The parameter code could do with tidying up, maybe with more of the
     features made available in ksh93.
  <li> Configuration files to enable zsh startup files to be created
     with the Dotfile Generator.
  <li> Further improvements in integrating the line editor with shell
     functions.
  <li> POSIX compatibility could be improved.
  <li> Option for glob qualifiers to follow perl syntax (a traditional item).
  </ul>
<p>

<h2>6.4: Did zsh have problems in the year 2000?</h2>
<p>
Not that I heard of; it's up to you to be careful with two-digit dates,
  though, which are produced by the prompt escapes <code>%W</code> and <code>%D</code>,
  and also by the command `<code>print -P</code>'.  Earlier versions of zsh may
  show problems here.
<p>
<h2>Acknowledgments:</h2>
<p>
Thanks to zsh-list, in particular Bart Schaefer, for suggestions
regarding this document.  Zsh has been in the hands of archivists Jim
Mattson, Bas de Bakker, Richard Coleman, Zoltan Hidvegi and Andrew
Main, and the mailing list has been run by Peter Gray, Rick Ohnemus,
Richard Coleman, Karsten Thygesen and Geoff Wing, all of whom deserve
thanks.  The world is eternally in the debt of Paul Falstad for inventing
zsh in the first place (though the wizzo extended completion is by Sven
Wischnowsky).
