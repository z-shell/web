<h1>Chapter 2: How does zsh differ from...?</h1>
<p>
As has already been mentioned, zsh is most similar to ksh, while many
of the additions are to please csh users.  Here are some more detailed
notes.  See also the article `UNIX shell differences and how to change
your shell' posted frequently to the USENET group comp.unix.shell.

<h2>2.1: Differences from sh and ksh</h2>
<a name="21"></a>
<p>
Most features of ksh (and hence also of sh) are implemented in zsh;
  problems can arise because the implementation is slightly different.
  Note also that not all ksh's are the same either.  I have based this
  on the 11/16/88f version of ksh; differences from ksh93 will be more
  substantial.
<p>
As a summary of the status:
  <ol>
  <li> because of all the options it is not safe to assume a general
     zsh run by a user will behave as if sh or ksh compatible;
  <li> invoking zsh as sh or ksh (or if either is a symbolic link to
     zsh) sets appropriate options and improves compatibility (from
     within zsh itself, calling <code>ARGV0=sh zsh</code> will also work);
  <li> from version 3.0 onward the degree of compatibility with sh
     under these circumstances is very high:  zsh can now be used
     with GNU configure or perl's Configure, for example;
  <li> the degree of compatibility with ksh is also high, but a few
     things are missing:  for example the more sophisticated
     pattern-matching expressions are different for versions before
     3.1.3 --- see the detailed list below;
  <li> also from 3.0, the command `emulate' is available: `emulate
     ksh' and `emulate sh' set various options as well as changing the
     effect of single-letter option flags as if the shell had been
     invoked with the appropriate name.  Including the command
     `emulate sh; setopt localoptions' in a shell function will
     turn on sh emulation for that function only.  In version 4 (and in
     3.0.6 through 8), this can be abbreviated as `emulate -L sh'.
   </ol>
<p>
The classic difference is word splitting, discussed in question <a href="FAQ03.html#31">3.1</a>;
  this catches out very many beginning zsh users.  As explained there,
  this is actually a bug in every other shell.  The answer is to set
  <code>SH_WORD_SPLIT</code> for backward compatibility.  The next most classic
  difference is that unmatched glob patterns cause the command to abort;
  set <code>NO_NOMATCH</code> for those.
<p>
Here is a list of various options which will increase ksh
  compatibility, though maybe decrease zsh's abilities: see the manual
  entries for <code>GLOB_SUBST</code>, <code>IGNORE_BRACES</code> (though brace expansion occurs
  in some versions of ksh), <code>KSH_ARRAYS</code>, <code>KSH_GLOB</code>, <code>KSH_OPTION_PRINT</code>,
  <code>LOCAL_OPTIONS</code>, <code>NO_BAD_PATTERN</code>, <code>NO_BANG_HIST</code>, <code>NO_EQUALS</code>, <code>NO_HUP</code>,
  <code>NO_NOMATCH</code>, <code>NO_RCS</code>, <code>NO_SHORT_LOOPS</code>, <code>PROMPT_SUBST</code>, <code>RM_STAR_SILENT</code>,
  <code>POSIX_ALIASES</code>, <code>POSIX_BUILTINS</code>, <code>POSIX_IDENTIFIERS</code>,
  <code>SH_FILE_EXPANSION</code>, <code>SH_GLOB</code>, <code>SH_OPTION_LETTERS</code>,
  <code>SH_WORD_SPLIT</code> (see question <a href="FAQ03.html#31">3.1</a>) and <code>SINGLE_LINE_ZLE</code>.
  Note that you can also disable any built-in commands which get in
  your way.  If invoked as `ksh', the shell will try to set suitable
  options.
<p>
Here are some differences from ksh which might prove significant for
  ksh programmers, some of which may be interpreted as bugs; there
  must be more.  Note that this list is deliberately rather full and
  that most of the items are fairly minor.  Those marked `*' perform
  in a ksh-like manner if the shell is invoked with the name `ksh', or
  if `emulate ksh' is in effect.  Capitalised words with underlines
  refer to shell options. 
<p>
<ul>
  <li> Syntax:
  <ul>
    <li>* Shell word splitting: see question <a href="FAQ03.html#31">3.1</a>.
    <li>* Arrays are (by default) more csh-like than ksh-like:
        subscripts start at 1, not 0; <code>array[0]</code> refers to <code>array[1]</code>;
        <code>$array</code> refers to the whole array, not <code>$array[0]</code>;
        braces are unnecessary: <code>$a[1] == ${a[1]}</code>, etc.
        Set the <code>KSH_ARRAYS</code> option for compatibility.
    <li>  Furthermore, individual elements of arrays in zsh are always
        strings, not separate parameters.  This means, for example, you
	can't `unset' an array element in zsh as you can in ksh; you
	can only set it to the empty string, or shorten the array.
	(You can unset elements of associative arrays in zsh because
	those are a completely different type of object.)
    <li>  Coprocesses are established by <code>coproc</code>; <code>|&amp;</code> behaves like
        csh.  Handling of coprocess file descriptors is also different.
    <li>  In <code>cmd1 &amp;&amp; cmd2 &amp;</code>, only <code>cmd2</code> instead of the whole
        expression is run in the background in zsh.  The manual implies
        this is a bug.  Use <code>{ cmd1 &amp;&amp; cmd2 } &amp;</code> as a workaround.
  </ul>
  <li> Command line substitutions, globbing etc.:
  <ul>
    <li>* Failure to match a globbing pattern causes an error (use
        <code>NO_NOMATCH</code>).
    <li>* The results of parameter substitutions are treated as plain text:
        <code>foo="*"; print $foo</code> prints all files in ksh but <code>*</code> in zsh
        (use <code>GLOB_SUBST</code>).
    <li>* <code>$PSn</code> do not do parameter substitution by default (use PROMPT_SUBST).
    <li>* Standard globbing does not allow ksh-style `pattern-lists'.
        Equivalents:
  <pre>

----------------------------------------------------------------------
      ksh              zsh         Meaning
     ------           ------       ---------
     !(foo)            ^foo        Anything but foo.
                or   foo1~foo2     Anything matching foo1 but foo2[1].
@(foo1|foo2|...)  (foo1|foo2|...)  One of foo1 or foo2 or ...
     ?(foo)           (foo|)       Zero or one occurrences of foo.
     *(foo)           (foo)#       Zero or more occurrences of foo.
     +(foo)           (foo)##      One or more occurrences of foo.
----------------------------------------------------------------------
      
</pre>

      The <code>^</code>, <code>~</code> and <code>#</code> (but not <code>|</code>)forms require <code>EXTENDED_GLOB</code>.
      From version 3.1.3, the ksh forms are fully supported when the
      option <code>KSH_GLOB</code> is in effect; for previous versions you
      must use the table above.
<p>
[1] See question <a href="FAQ03.html#327">3.27</a> for more on the mysteries of
        <code>~</code> and <code>^</code>.
    <li>  Unquoted assignments do file expansion after <code>:</code>s (intended for
        PATHs). 
    <li>* <code>typeset</code> and <code>integer</code> have special behaviour for
        assignments in ksh, but not in zsh.  For example, this doesn't
        work in zsh:
  <pre>

          integer k=$(wc -l ~/.zshrc)
      
</pre>

        because the return value from <code>wc</code> includes leading
        whitespace which causes wordsplitting.  Ksh handles the
        assignment specially as a single word.
  </ul>
  <li> Command execution:
  <ul>
    <li>* There is no <code>$ENV</code> variable (use <code>/etc/zshrc</code>, <code>~/.zshrc</code>; 
        note also <code>$ZDOTDIR</code>).
    <li>* <code>$PATH</code> is not searched for commands specified
        at invocation without -c.
  </ul>
  <li> Aliases and functions:
  <ul>
    <li>  The order in which aliases and functions are defined is significant:
        function definitions with () expand aliases -- see question <a href="FAQ02.html#23">2.3</a>.
    <li>  Aliases and functions cannot be exported.
    <li>  There are no tracked aliases: command hashing replaces these.
    <li>  The use of aliases for key bindings is replaced by `bindkey'.
    <li>* Options are not local to functions (use LOCAL_OPTIONS; note this
        may always be unset locally to propagate options settings from a
        function to the calling level).
    <li>  Functions defined with `function funcname { body }' behave the
        same way as those defined with `funcname () { body }'.  In ksh,
        the former behave as if the body were read from a file with `.',
        and only the latter behave as true functions.
  </ul>
    <li> Traps and signals:
  <ul>
    <li>* Traps are not local to functions.  The option LOCAL_TRAPS is
          available from 3.1.6.
    <li>  TRAPERR has become TRAPZERR (this was forced by UNICOS which
        has SIGERR).
  </ul>
  <li> Editing:
  <ul>
    <li>  The options <code>gmacs</code>, <code>viraw</code> are not supported.
        Use bindkey to change the editing behaviour: <code>set -o {emacs,vi}</code>
        becomes `bindkey -{e,v}', although `set -o emacs' and `set -o vi'
        are supported for compatibility; for gmacs, go to emacs mode and
        use `bindkey \^t gosmacs-transpose-characters'.
    <li>  The <code>keyword</code> option does not exist and <code>-k</code> is instead
        interactivecomments.  (<code>keyword</code> is not in recent versions
        of ksh either.)
    <li>* Management of histories in multiple shells is different:
        the history list is not saved and restored after each command.
        The option <code>SHARE_HISTORY</code> appeared in 3.1.6 and is set in ksh
        compatibility mode to remedy this.
    <li>  <code>\</code> does not escape editing chars (use <code>^V</code>).
    <li>  Not all ksh bindings are set (e.g. <code>&lt;ESC&gt;#</code>; try <code>&lt;ESC&gt;q</code>).
    <li>* <code>#</code> in an interactive shell is not treated as a comment by
        default.
    <li>  In vi command mode the keys "k" and "j" move the cursor to the
        end of the line.  To move the cursor to the start instead, use
  <pre>

          bindkey -M vicmd 'k' vi-up-line-or-history
          bindkey -M vicmd 'j' vi-down-line-or-history
  
</pre>

  </ul>
  <li> Built-in commands:
  <ul>
    <li>  Some built-ins (<code>r</code>, <code>autoload</code>, <code>history</code>, <code>integer</code> ...)
        were aliases in ksh. 
    <li>  There is no built-in command newgrp: use e.g. <code>alias
        newgrp="exec newgrp"</code>
    <li>  <code>jobs</code> has no <code>-n</code> flag.
  </ul>
  <li> Other idiosyncrasies:
  <ul>
    <li>  <code>select</code> always redisplays the list of selections on each loop.
  </ul>
  </ul>

<h2>2.2: Similarities with csh</h2>
<p>
Although certain features aim to ease the withdrawal symptoms of csh
  (ab)users, the syntax is in general rather different and you should
  certainly not try to run scripts without modification.  The c2z script
  is provided with the source (in Misc/c2z) to help convert .cshrc
  and .login files; see also the next question concerning aliases,
  particularly those with arguments.
<p>
Csh-compatibility additions include:
  <ul>
  <li>  <code>logout</code>, <code>rehash</code>, <code>source</code>, <code>(un)limit</code> built-in commands.
  <li>  <code>*rc</code> file for interactive shells.
  <li>  Directory stacks.
  <li>  <code>cshjunkie*</code>, <code>ignoreeof</code> options.
  <li>  The <code>CSH_NULL_GLOB</code> option.
  <li>  <code>&gt;&amp;</code>, <code>|&amp;</code> etc. redirection.
      (Note that <code>&gt;file 2&gt;&amp;1</code> is the standard Bourne shell command for
      csh's <code>&gt;&amp;file</code>.)
  <li>  <code>foreach ...</code> loops; alternative syntax for other loops.
  <li>  Alternative syntax <code>if ( ... ) ...</code>, though this still doesn't
      work like csh: it expects a command in the parentheses.  Also
      <code>for</code>, <code>which</code>.
  <li>  <code>$PROMPT</code> as well as <code>$PS1</code>, <code>$status</code> as well as <code>$?</code>,
      <code>$#argv</code> as well as <code>$#</code>, .... 
  <li>  Escape sequences via <code>%</code> for prompts.
  <li>  Special array variables <code>$PATH</code> etc. are colon-separated, <code>$path</code>
      are arrays.
  <li>  <code>!</code>-type history (which may be turned off via <code>setopt
      nobanghist</code>).
  <li>  Arrays have csh-like features (see under <a href="FAQ02.html#21">2.1</a>).
  </ul>
<p>
<a name="l12"></a>
<h2>2.3: Why do my csh aliases not work?  (Plus other alias pitfalls.)</h2>
<a name="23"></a>
<p>
First of all, check you are using the syntax
  <pre>

    alias newcmd='list of commands'
  
</pre>

  and not
  <pre>

    alias newcmd 'list of commands'
  
</pre>

  which won't work. (It tells you if `newcmd' and `list of commands' are
  already defined as aliases.)
<p>
Otherwise, your aliases probably contain references to the command
  line of the form <code>\!*</code>, etc.  Zsh does not handle this behaviour as it
  has shell functions which provide a way of solving this problem more
  consistent with other forms of argument handling.  For example, the
  csh alias
  <pre>

    alias cd 'cd \!*; echo $cwd'
  
</pre>

  can be replaced by the zsh function,
  <pre>

    cd() { builtin cd "$@"; echo $PWD; }
  
</pre>

  (the `builtin' tells zsh to use its own `cd', avoiding an infinite loop)
  or, perhaps better,
  <pre>

    cd() { builtin cd "$@"; print -D $PWD; }
  
</pre>

  (which converts your home directory to a <code>~</code>).  In fact, this problem is
  better solved by defining the special function chpwd() (see
  the manual). Note also that the <code>;</code> at the end of the function is
  optional in zsh, but not in ksh or sh (for sh's where it exists).
<p>
Here is Bart Schaefer's guide to converting csh aliases for zsh.
<p>
<ol>
  <li> If the csh alias references "parameters" (<code>\!:1</code>, <code>\!*</code> etc.),
     then in zsh you need a function (referencing <code>$1</code>, <code>$*</code> etc.).
     Otherwise, you can use a zsh alias.
<p>
<li> If you use a zsh function, you need to refer _at_least_ to
     <code>$*</code> in the body (inside the <code>{ }</code>).  Parameters don't magically
     appear inside the <code>{ }</code> the way they get appended to an alias.
<p>
<li> If the csh alias references its own name (<code>alias rm "rm -i"</code>),
     then in a zsh function you need the "command" or "builtin" keyword
     (function <code>rm() { command rm -i "$@" }</code>), but in a zsh alias
     you don't (<code>alias rm="rm -i"</code>).
<p>
<li> If you have aliases that refer to each other (<code>alias ls "ls -C";
     alias lf "ls -F" ==&gt; lf == ls -C -F</code>) then you must either:
  <ul>
        <li> convert all of them to zsh functions; or
        <li> after converting, be sure your .zshrc defines all of your
           aliases before it defines any of your functions.
         </ul>
<p>
Those first four are all you really need, but here are four more for
     heavy csh alias junkies:
<p>
<li> Mapping from csh alias "parameter referencing" into zsh function
     (assuming <code>SH_WORD_SPLIT</code> and <code>KSH_ARRAYS</code> are NOT set in zsh):
       <pre>

      csh             zsh
     =====         ==========
     \!*           $*              (or $argv)
     \!^           $1              (or $argv[1])
     \!:1          $1
     \!:2          $2              (or $argv[2], etc.)
     \!$           $*[$#]          (or $argv[$#], or $*[-1])
     \!:1-4        $*[1,4]
     \!:1-         $*[1,$#-1]      (or $*[1,-2])
     \!^-          $*[1,$#-1]
     \!*:q         "$@"
     \!*:x         $=*             ($*:x doesn't work (yet))
        
</pre>

<p>
<li> Remember that it is NOT a syntax error in a zsh function to
     refer to a position (<code>$1</code>, <code>$2</code>, etc.) greater than the number of
     parameters. (E.g., in a csh alias, a reference to <code>\!:5</code> will
     cause an error if 4 or fewer arguments are given; in a zsh
     function, <code>$5</code> is the empty string if there are 4 or fewer
     parameters.)
<p>
<li> To begin a zsh alias with a - (dash, hyphen) character, use
     <code>alias --</code>:
      <pre>

             csh                            zsh
        ===============             ==================
        alias - "fg %-"             alias -- -="fg %-"
      
</pre>

<p>
<li> Stay away from <code>alias -g</code> in zsh until you REALLY know what
     you're doing.
  </ol>
<p>
There is one other serious problem with aliases: consider
  <pre>

    alias l='/bin/ls -F'
    l() { /bin/ls -la "$@" | more }
  
</pre>

  <code>l</code> in the function definition is in command position and is expanded
  as an alias, defining <code>/bin/ls</code> and <code>-F</code> as functions which call
  <code>/bin/ls</code>, which gets a bit recursive.  This can be avoided if you use
  <code>function</code> to define a function, which doesn't expand aliases.  It is
  possible to argue for extra warnings somewhere in this mess.
<p>
One workaround for this is to use the "function" keyword instead:
  <pre>

    alias l='/bin/ls -F'
    function l { /bin/ls -la "$@" | more }
  
</pre>

  The <code>l</code> after <code>function</code> is not expanded.  Note you don't need
  the <code>LPAR()RPAR()</code> in this case, although it's harmless.
<p>
You need to be careful if you are defining a function with multiple
  names; most people don't need to do this, so it's an unusual problem,
  but in case you do you should be aware that in versions of the shell
  before 5.1 names after the first <em>were</em> expanded:
  <pre>

    function a b c { ... }
  
</pre>

  Here, <code>b</code> and <code>c</code>, but not <code>a</code>, have aliases expanded.
  This oddity was fixed in version 5.1.
<p>
The rest of this item assumes you use the (more common,
  but equivalent) <code>LPAR()RPAR()</code> definitions.
<p>
Bart Schaefer's rule is:  Define first those aliases you expect to
  use in the body of a function, but define the function first if the
  alias has the same name as the function.
<p>
If you aware of the problem, you can always escape part or all of the
  name of the function:
  <pre>

     'l'() { /bin/ls -la "$@" | more }
  
</pre>

  Adding the quotes has no effect on the function definition, but
  suppresses alias expansion for the function name.  Hence this is
  guaranteed to be safe---unless you are in the habit of defining
  aliases for expressions such as <code>'l'</code>, which is valid, but probably
  confusing.
<p>

<h2>2.4: Similarities with tcsh</h2>
<p>
(The sections on csh apply too, of course.)  Certain features have
  been borrowed from tcsh, including <code>$watch</code>, <code>run-help</code>, <code>$savehist</code>,
  periodic commands etc., extended prompts, <code>sched</code> and <code>which</code> built-ins.
  Programmable completion was inspired by, but is entirely different to,
  tcsh's <code>complete</code>.  (There is a perl script called <code>lete2ctl</code> in the
  Misc directory of the source distribution to convert <code>complete</code> to <code>compctl</code>
  statements.)  This list is not definitive: some features have gone in
  the other direction.
<p>
If you're missing the editor function <code>run-fg-editor</code>, try something
  with <code>bindkey -s</code> (which binds a string to a keystroke), e.g.
  <pre>

    bindkey -s '^z' '\eqfg %$EDITOR:t\n'
  
</pre>

  which pushes the current line onto the stack and tries to bring a job
  with the basename of your editor into the foreground.  <code>bindkey -s</code>
  allows limitless possibilities along these lines.  You can execute
  any command in the middle of editing a line in the same way,
  corresponding to tcsh's <code>-c</code> option:
  <pre>

    bindkey -s '^p' '\eqpwd\n'
  
</pre>

  In both these examples, the <code>\eq</code> saves the current input line to
  be restored after the command runs; a better effect with multiline
  buffers is achieved if you also have
  <pre>

    bindkey '\eq' push-input
  
</pre>

  to save the entire buffer.  In version 4 and recent versions of zsh 3.1,
  you have the following more sophisticated option,
  <pre>

    run-fg-editor() {
      zle push-input
      BUFFER="fg %$EDITOR:t"
      zle accept-line
    }
    zle -N run-fg-editor
  
</pre>

  and can now bind <code>run-fg-editor</code> just like any other editor function.
<p>
<a name="l14"></a>
<h2>2.5: Similarities with bash</h2>
<p>
The Bourne-Again Shell, bash, is another enhanced Bourne-like shell;
  the most obvious difference from zsh is that it does not attempt to
  emulate the Korn shell.  Since both shells are under active
  development it is probably not sensible to be too specific here.
  Broadly, bash has paid more attention to standards compliancy
  (i.e. POSIX) for longer, and has so far avoided the more abstruse
  interactive features (programmable completion, etc.) that zsh has.
<p>
In recent years there has been a certain amount of crossover in the
  extensions, however.  Zsh (as of 3.1.6) has bash's `<code>${var/old/new}</code>'
  feature for replacing the text <code>old</code> with the text <code>new</code> in the
  parameter <code>$var</code>.  Note one difference here:  while both shells
  implement the syntax `<code>${var/#old/new}</code>' and `<code>${var/%old/new}</code>' for
  anchoring the match of <code>old</code> to the start or end of the parameter text,
  respectively, in zsh you can't put the `<code>#</code>' or `<code>%</code>' inside a
  parameter:  in other words `<code>{var/$old/new}</code>' where <code>old</code> begins with
  a `<code>#</code>' treats that as an ordinary character in zsh, unlike bash.  To
  do this sort of thing in zsh you can use (from 3.1.7) the new syntax
  for anchors in any pattern, `<code>(#s)</code>' to match the start of a string,
  and `<code>(#e)</code>' to match the end.  These require the option
  <code>EXTENDED_GLOB</code> to be set.
<p>
<a name="l15"></a>
<h2>2.6: Shouldn't zsh be more/less like ksh/(t)csh?</h2>
<p>
People often ask why zsh has all these `unnecessary' csh-like features,
  or alternatively why zsh doesn't understand more csh syntax.  This is
  far from a definitive answer and the debate will no doubt continue.
<p>
Paul's object in writing zsh was to produce a ksh-like shell which
  would have features familiar to csh users.  For a long time, csh was
  the preferred interactive shell and there is a strong resistance to
  changing to something unfamiliar, hence the additional syntax and
  <code>CSH_JUNKIE</code> options.  This argument still holds.  On the other hand,
  the arguments for having what is close to a plug-in replacement for ksh
  are, if anything, even more powerful:  the deficiencies of csh as a
  programming language are well known (look in any Usenet FAQ archive, e.g.
    <a href="http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/unix-faq/shell/csh-whynot/faq.html">http://www.cis.ohio-state.edu/hypertext/faq/usenet/unix-faq/\ 
        shell/csh-whynot/faq.html</a>
  if you are in any doubt) and zsh is able to run many standard
  scripts such as /etc/rc.
<p>
Of course, this makes zsh rather large and feature-ridden so that it
  seems to appeal mainly to hackers.  The only answer, perhaps not
  entirely satisfactory, is that you have to ignore the bits you don't
  want.  The introduction of loadable in modules in version 3.1 should
  help.

<h2>2.7: What is zsh's support for Unicode/UTF-8?</h2>
<p>
`Unicode', or UCS for Universal Character Set, is the modern way
  of specifying character sets.  It replaces a large number of ad hoc
  ways of supporting character sets beyond ASCII.  `UTF-8' is an
  encoding of Unicode that is particularly natural on Unix-like systems.
<p>
The production branch of zsh, 4.2, has very limited support:
  the built-in printf command supports "\u" and "\U" escapes
  to output arbitrary Unicode characters; ZLE (the Zsh Line Editor) has
  no concept of character encodings, and is confused by multi-octet
  encodings.
<p>
However, the 4.3 branch has much better support, and furthermore this
  is now fairly stable.  (Only a few minor areas need fixing before
  this becomes a production release.)  This is discussed more
  fully below, see `Multibyte input and output'.
