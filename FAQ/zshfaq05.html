<h1>Chapter 5: Multibyte input and output</h1>

<h2>5.1: What is multibyte input?</h2>
<p>
For a long time computers had a simple idea of a character: each octet
  (8-bit byte) of text contained one character.  This meant an application
  could only use 256 characters at once.  The first 128 characters (0 to
  127) on Unix and similar systems usually corresponded to the ASCII
  character set, as they still do.  So all other possibilities had to be
  crammed into the remaining 128.  This was done by picking the appropriate
  character set for the use you were making.  For example, ISO 8859
  specified a set of extensions to ASCII for various alphabets.
<p>
This was fine for simple extensions and certain short enough relatives of
  the Latin alphabet (with no more than a few dozen alphabetic characters),
  but useless for complex alphabets.  Also, having a different character
  set for each language is inconvenient: you have to start a new terminal
  to run the shell with each character set.  So the character set had to be
  extended.  To cut a long story short, the world has mostly standardised
  on a character set called Unicode, related to the international standard
  ISO 10646.  The intention is that this will contain every single
  character used in all the languages of the world.
<p>
This has far too many characters to fit into a single octet.  What's
  more, UNIX utilities such as zsh are so used to dealing with ASCII that
  removing it would cause no end of trouble.  So what happens is this: the
  128 ASCII characters are kept exactly the same (and they're the same as
  the first 128 characters of Unicode), but the remaining 128 characters
  are used to build up any other Unicode character by combining multiple
  octets together.  The shell doesn't need to interpret these directly; it
  just needs to ask the system library how many octets form the next
  character, and if there's a valid character there at all.  (It can also
  ask the system what width the character takes up on the screen, so that
  characters no longer need to be exactly one position wide.)
<p>
The way this is done is called UTF-8.  Multibyte encodings of other
  character sets exist (you might encounter them for Asian character sets);
  zsh will be able to use any such encoding as long as it contains ASCII as
  a single-octet subset and the system can provide information about other
  characters.  However, in the case of Unicode, UTF-8 is the only one you
  are likely to enounter that is useful in zsh.
<p>
(In case you're confused: Unicode is the character set, while UTF-8 is
  an encoding of it.  You might hear about other encodings, such as UCS-2
  and UCS-4 which are basically the character's index in the character set
  as a two-octet or four-octet integer.  You might see files encoded this
  way, for example on Windows, but the shell can't deal directly with text
  in those formats.)
<p>

<h2>5.2: How does zsh handle multibyte input and output?</h2>
<p>
Until version 4.3, zsh didn't handle multibyte input properly at all.
  Each octet in a multibyte character would look to the shell like a
  separate character.  If your terminal handled the character set,
  characters might appear correct on screen, but trying to edit them would
  cause all sorts of odd effects.  (It was possible to edit in zsh using
  single-byte extensions of ASCII such as the ISO 8859 family, however.)
<p>
From version 4.3.4, multibyte input is handled in the line editor if zsh
  has been compiled with the appropriate definitions, and is automatically
  activated.  This is indicated by the option <code>MULTIBYTE</code>, which is
  set by default on shells that support multibyte mode.  Hence you
  can test this with a standard option test:  `<code>[[ -o multibyte ]]</code>'.
<p>
The <code>MULTIBYTE</code> option affects the entire shell: parameter expansion,
  pattern matching, etc. count valid multibyte character strings as a
  single character.  You can unset the option locally in a function to
  revert to single-byte operation.
<p>
Note that if the shell is emulating a Bourne shell the <code>MULTIBYTE</code>
  option is unset by default.  This allows various POSIX modes to
  work normally (POSIX does not deal with multibyte characters).  If
  you use a "sh" or "ksh" emulation interactively you should probably
  set the <code>MULTIBYTE</code> option.
<p>
The other option that affects multibyte support is <code>COMBINING_CHARS</code>,
  new in version 4.3.9.  When this is set, any zero-length punctuation
  characters that follow an alphanumeric character (the base character) are
  assumed to be modifications (accents etc.) to the base character and to
  be displayed within the same screen area as the base character.  As not
  all terminals handle this, even if they correctly display the base
  multibyte character, this option is not on by default.  Recent versions
  of the KDE and GNOME terminal emulators <code>konsole</code> and
  <code>gnome-terminal</code> as well as <code>rxvt-unicode</code>, and the Unicode version
  of xterm, <code>xterm -u8</code> or the front-end <code>uxterm</code>, are known to handle
  combining characters.
<p>
The <code>COMBINING_CHARS</code> option only affects output; combining characters
  may always be input, but when the option is off will be displayed
  specially.  By default this is as a code point (the index of the
  character in the character set) between angle brackets, usually
  in inverse video.  Highlighting of such special characters can
  be modified using the new array parameter <code>zle_highlight</code>.

<h2>5.3: How do I ensure multibyte input and output work on my system?</h2>
<p>
Once you have a version of zsh with multibyte support, you need to
  ensure the environment is correct.  We'll assume you're using UTF-8.
  Many modern systems may come set up correctly already.  Try one of
  the editing widgets described in the next section to see.
<p>
There are basically three components.
<p>
<ul>
   <li> The locale.  This describes a whole series of features specific
      to countries or regions of which the character set is one.  Usually
      it is controlled by the environment variable <code>LANG</code> (there are
      others but this is the one to start with).  You need to find a
      locale whose name contains <code>UTF-8</code>.  This will be a variant on
      your usual locale, which typically indicates the language and
      country; for example, mine is <code>en_GB.UTF-8</code>.  Luckily, zsh can
      complete locale names, so if you have the new completion system
      loaded you can type <code>export LANG=</code> and attempt to complete a
      suitable locale.  It's the locale that tells the shell to expect the
      right form of multibyte input.  (However, there's no guarantee that
      the shell is actually going to get this input: for example, if you
      edit file names that have been created using a different character
      set it won't work properly.)
   <li> The terminal emulator.  Those that are supplied with a recent
      desktop environment, such as <code>konsole</code> and <code>gnome-terminal</code>, are
      likely to have extensive support for localization and may work
      correctly as soon as they know the locale.  You can enable UTF-8
      support for <code>xterm</code> in its application defaults file.  The
      following are the relevant resources; you don't actually need all of
      them, as described below.  If you use a <code>~/.Xdefaults</code> or
      <code>~/.Xresources</code> file for setting resources, prefix all the lines
      with <code>xterm</code>:
      <pre>

        *wideChars: true
        *locale: true
        *utf8: 1
        *vt100Graphics: true
      
</pre>

      This turns on support for wide characters (this is enabled by the
      <code>utf8</code> resource, too); enables conversions to UTF-8 from other
      locales (this is the key resource and actually overrides
      <code>utf8</code>); turns on UTF-8 mode (this resource is mostly used to
      force use of UTF-8 characters if your locale system isn't up to it);
      and allows certain graphic characters to work even with UTF-8
      enabled.  (Thanks to Phil Pennock for suggestions.)
   <li> The font.  If you selected this from a menu in your terminal
      emulator, there's a good chance it already selected the right
      character set to go with it.  If you hand-picked an old fashioned
      X font with a lot of dashes, you need to make sure it ends with
      the right character encoding, <code>iso10646-1</code> (and not, for
      example, <code>iso8859-1</code>).  Not all characters will be available
      in any font, and some fonts may have a more restricted range of
      Unicode characters than others.
  </ul>
<p>
As mentioned in the previous section, <code>bindkey -m</code> now outputs
  a warning message telling you that multibyte input from the terminal
  is likely not to work.  (See <a href="zshfaq03.html#35">3.5</a> if you don't know what
  this feature does.)  If your terminal doesn't have characters
  that need to be input as multibyte, however, you can still use
  the meta bindings and can ignore the warning message.  Use
  <code>bindkey -m 2&gt;/dev/null</code> to suppress it.
<p>
You might also note that the latest version of the Cygwin environment
  for Windows supports UTF-8.  In previous versions, zsh was able
  to compile with the <code>MULTIBYTE</code> option enabled, but the system
  didn't provide full support for it.

<h2>5.4: How can I input characters that aren't on my keyboard?</h2>
<p>
Two functions are provided with zsh that help you input characters.
  As with all editing widgets implemented by functions, you need to
  mark the function for autoload, create the widget, and, if you are
  going to use it frequently, bind it to a key sequence.  The
  following binds <code>insert-composed-char</code> to F5 on my keyboard:
  <pre>

    autoload -Uz insert-composed-char
    zle -N insert-composed-char
    bindkey '\e[15~' insert-composed-char
  
</pre>

<p>
The two widgets are described in the <code>zshcontrib(1)</code> manual
  page, but here is a brief summary:
<p>
<code>insert-composed-char</code> is followed by two characters that
  are a mnemonic for a multibyte character.  For example <code>a:</code>
  is a with an Umlaut; <code>cH</code> is the symbol for hearts on a playing
  card.  Various accented characters, European and related alphabets,
  and punctuation and mathematical symbols are available.  The
  mnemonics are mostly those given by RFC 1345, see
  <a href="http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html">http://www.faqs.org/rfcs/rfc1345.html</a>.
<p>
<code>insert-unicode-char</code> is used to input a Unicode character by
  its hexadecimal number.  This is the number given in the Unicode
  character charts, see for example <a href="http://www.unicode.org/charts/">http://www.unicode.org/charts/</a>.
  You need to execute the function, then type the hexadecimal number
  (you can omit any leading zeroes), then execute the function again.
<p>
Both functions can be used without multibyte mode, provided the locale is
  correct and the character selected exists in the current character set;
  however, using UTF-8 massively extends the number of valid characters
  that can be produced.
<p>
If you have a recent X Window System installation, you might find
  the <code>AltGr</code> key helps you input accented Latin characters; for
  example on my keyboard <code>AltGr-; e</code> gives <code>e</code> with an acute accent.
  See also <a href="http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html#input">http://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/~mgk25/unicode.html#input</a>
  for general information on entering Unicode characters from a keyboard.
