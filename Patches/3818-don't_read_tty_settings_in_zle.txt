(Look! There's real grammar in the subject line this time.  Or,
subject line grammar reality surprise, as I would usually put it.)

Some time ago I complained that zsh was messing up my tty settings
when I killed jobs in the background.  I've had a closer look and
found out it wasn't that simple.  I have a completion function for
kill which prints the job name as a comment after %no, and I
habitually use it for killing things since I'm lazy.  It was _this_
job exiting which caused the tty setting to be read, and since zle was
active they were messed up:  nothing to do with genuine job control.

The answer is easy:  don't get the current tty settings when zle is
active.  This patch is for 3.1.x, but probably applies to 3.0.5, too.
