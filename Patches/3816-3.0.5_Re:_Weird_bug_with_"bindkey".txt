This is the corresponding patch.  Key binding was rather simpler, so
it's shorter.  One of the errors was a zerr() instead of a zerrnam(),
which are not usually used in builtins.  I've just assumed that was an
inconsistency. (Goodness!  An inconsistency in zsh!  Whatever next, a
stone in the Great Wall of China??)

If you're looking around, you'll notice other zerr()'s in zle_main.c
haven't been touched, because they're part of the editor itself, not
bindkey, so they really should abort back to main command level.  I
think.  All zerr/zerrnam vs. zwarnnam in the shell are potentially
negotiable (although builtins should certainly have zwarnnam(), as
here).
