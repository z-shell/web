Nope, I don't think you did ... I guess the moral of this story
is, if you're a newbie who asks on zsh-users whether something
is possible, gets no response and decides to write a patch to do
it, join zsh-workers before you start work on it rather than
when it's ready for release :-/

Sorry if this is a silly question, but where can I get your
patch?  It sounds a bit more generalised than the one you posted
here dated 16th Jan 1998.  My patch is very similar to the
latter, with some small differences:

- yours is probably better, as you know far more about zsh
  internals
- yours doesn't have a reverse-complete-history thing (correct
  me if I'm wrong)
- I introduced an extra state to `validlist' so that if you
  press M-/ and then TAB it reverts to the normal completion.
